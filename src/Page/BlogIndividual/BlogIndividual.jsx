                      In the first recording, you should listen to a

                      asked to you. Now these recordings can be in any accent
                      like American, British, Australian or even Asian English.

                        about. Be sure of what you are saying because the
                        examiner may ask you difficult questions and put you in
                        a spot. Don't feel too excited or even nervous when
                        answering the examiner.Answer calmly and wisely.

                        Just answer as much as you know and tell the examiner if
                        you don't know.

                        is speed reading. You can develop this skill only if you
                        develop the habit of reading. Read a lot before taking
                        the exam. Try to understand the passages from the very
                        first reading because you won't have much time to read
                        them again.

                        correctly. Remember what the writer wants to say in
                        these paragraphs and how he builds his argument around
                        it.

                        250-word essay, both in 60 minutes. It is wisest to
                        finish the essay first as it takes more time and then
                        move on to Task 1.

                        main idea of â€‹â€‹the essay accurately and clearly. Also,
                        make the argumentation of the topic smooth, so that each
                        paragraph seems to relate to the previous one. You don't
                        want your essay to look like a random collection of
                        facts, but rather a strong piece of writing that
                        explains the topic.

                        given diagram. Also understand the given values â€‹â€‹and
                        make a description using the comparison of these values.
                        Do not make any part of the description too long; keep
                        it to the point and simple. A clear and appropriate
                        description is what you want to present to the
                        researcher.

                        Also, don't do punctuation or use abbreviations as these
                        can affect your score. Use productive language in your

                      The time it takes to prepare for IELTS depends on how well
                      you know English. If you are confident in your language
                      skills, you don't need much time to prepare for IELTS.
                      However, if you are not confident enough, you should
                      improve your skills first. Read lots of newspapers and
                      magazines and watch English language news channels like
                      the BBC
